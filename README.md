## Short description
Application for contact tracing and symptom monitoring within Caribbean islands.

### What's the problem?

As a region, the Caribbean economy relies heavily on tourism and therefore it was imperative that countries, especially Jamaica, open their borders during the COVID-19 pandemic. Doing so safely, requires frequent testing and putting the infrastructure in place to monitor visitors and effectively carry out contact tracing when necessary. Due to the high cost of testing, we have already seen where the testing efforts of Jamaica have dwindled and many visitors are entering the island without being tested. There is also no system in place to monitor tourist movement across the island after the quarantine period. While imported cases are of high concern, any solution to this issue should be able to scale to local citizens of the country as well.

### The idea

Covy was built as a mobile app to solve the aforementioned problems by making it easy for tourists to monitor their covid-related symptoms as soon as they enter the country. While they are in the country, Covy acts as their companion, allowing them to update any changes in their symptoms/health each day.
